# wwgb-wolang
A demo project for the Women Who Go Berlin presentation @Talon.One HQ.

The purpose of this project is to create an interpreter, wolang. At the Women Who Go meetup, attendees will write missing functionality into the code base. 

Here are the steps we took to create wolang:

Step 1
 - Create plus and strconcat functions
 - Create eval and evalFCall functions
 - Create a main() function to run examples for eval

Step 2
- Write extfuncdef struct type with name and implementation
- Write callable type interface and functions Name and Call
- Create a simple extfuncdef and edit evalFCall to include extfuncdef's

Step 3
- Split the functions into different files. Somthing like:
    - builtInFunctions: plus, strconcat
    - extension: extfuncdef, callable, name, call
    - wolang: eval, evalFCall
- Be sure all the files have `package wolang` on the first line
- Make the necessary functions public by capitalizing the func name, such as eval -> Eval
- Create another package wolang-cli and move main (into a main.go file) there with wolang imported
- `go run main.go` to check that everything works

Step 4
- Make it such that extfuncdef's can be added with Eval
    - Make necessary functions public
    - Write RegExtFunc

Step 5
- Change Eval and/or EvalFCall such that a nested expression can be evaluated
    - example: `nestedExpr := []interface{}{"+", 3, 4, []interface{}{"+", 5, 6}}`
